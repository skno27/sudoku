Sudoku Solver Program I learned from TechWithTim GitHub
There is a GUI for a sudoku game written in pygame as well

Here is the code for the original
https://github.com/techwithtim/Sudoku-GUI-Solver

I plan to attempt improvements, perhaps a gpt connection for generating new sudoku puzzles, or a simple window at game start that allows the user to choose a puzzle

I had conveniently added configuration files to my project

If you are using pip for package management, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are using conda for package management, run:

conda env create -f environment.yml
